## guide to namd accel

# 0. dont use accel for min / equil
they take like 20 mins anyways

# 1. using gpus
gpus can only be used without constraints
margin must be small (<=2.0)
ncpus must be large (at least 8, needs further testing)\
or else it explodes

# 2. using avx512
needs avx512f and avx512dq
prefix job with
#PBS -l select=cpuflags=avx512f
idk how to do both
usually one comes with the other
